# Migration to Create Figma Plugin

## Build System Clarification

### Previous Setup
- Custom webpack configuration
- Manual TypeScript configuration
- Manual bundling setup
- Separate configuration for UI and plugin code

### Current Setup (Create Figma Plugin)
- Uses `esbuild` (NOT webpack) as the bundler
- Pre-configured TypeScript settings
- Automated bundling process with output in `/build`
- Unified configuration for UI and plugin code
- Tailwind CSS integration with direct build output

### Key Differences
1. **Bundler**:
   - Before: webpack (manual configuration)
   - Now: esbuild (faster, pre-configured)
   - Impact: Same end result, different tooling

2. **TypeScript**:
   - Before: Same TypeScript, but with looser configuration
   - Now: Same TypeScript, but with stricter type checking
   - Impact: Need to fix type issues that were previously ignored

3. **Build Process**:
   - Before: Multiple manual configurations
   - Now: Single, unified build process
   - Impact: Simpler but less customizable

## Impact Analysis

### What Changes
1. **Build System**:
   - From: Custom webpack configuration
   - To: Create Figma Plugin (esbuild)
   - Impact: Only affects how code is compiled and bundled
   - âœ… No change to plugin logic required

2. **UI Framework**:
   - From: React + shadcn/ui
   - To: Preact + @create-figma-plugin/ui
   - Impact: Only affects UI implementation
   - âœ… No change to plugin logic required

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Issue: Stricter TypeScript checking in new setup
   - Impact: Need to add proper type annotations
   - âœ… No change to actual logic, just better type safety

### What Stays the Same
1. **Core Plugin Logic**:
   - Frame property handling
   - Class saving/loading
   - Property application logic
   - Event handling logic

2. **Data Structure**:
   - Frame properties format
   - Saved classes structure
   - Message format between UI and plugin

## Current Status (as of Jan 18, 2025)

### Decision Changes
- Initially planned to use webpack + shadcn/ui
- Switched to Create Figma Plugin due to:
  1. Better integration with Figma's ecosystem
  2. Pre-configured build system with esbuild
  3. Ready-to-use Preact components matching Figma's UI
  4. Production-tested solution

### Implementation Status
1. âœ… Basic project setup with Create Figma Plugin
2. âœ… TypeScript configuration
3. âœ… Preact + Tailwind CSS integration
4. âœ… Project structure cleanup
   - Removed redundant `/dist` directory
   - Configured `/build` as standard output
   - Cleaned up unnecessary files
5. ðŸŸ¡ UI Migration (In Progress)
   - Basic UI structure implemented
   - Components rendering properly
   - Event handling partially working
   - Layout and styling needs refinement
6. ðŸŸ¡ Plugin Logic Migration (In Progress)
   - Frame properties saving/applying implemented
   - Type safety improvements ongoing
   - Event handling system working

### Current Issues
1. UI Refinement:
   - Dropdown menu positioning and behavior needs improvement
   - Layout spacing and alignment needs adjustment
   - Some components need better styling integration with Figma's UI patterns

2. Plugin Logic:
   - Some type safety improvements still needed
   - Need to verify all frame properties are handled correctly
   - Event system needs more robust error handling

3. Build Configuration:
   âœ… manifest.json configured correctly
   âœ… Build output directory standardized to `/build`
   âœ… Styles bundling working with Tailwind
   âœ… TypeScript configuration verified

### Next Steps
1. UI Polish:
   - Improve dropdown menu behavior
   - Refine layout spacing and alignment
   - Ensure consistent styling with Figma's UI

2. Code Quality:
   - Complete type safety improvements
   - Add error boundaries and better error handling
   - Implement comprehensive validation

3. Testing:
   - Create test cases for each feature
   - Verify UI rendering in both light/dark modes
   - Test frame property handling
