# Project Overview

## Goal

Develop a Figma plugin that allows users to save, manage, and apply frame styles as reusable CSS-like classes to streamline design workflows.

## Architecture

- **Core Logic:** Implemented in TypeScript for robust type-checking and maintainability.
- **UI Layer:** Built using an HTML interface with vanilla JavaScript for lightweight and fast performance.
- **Data Storage:** Localized JSON-based storage to save and manage classes.
- **Plugin Framework:** Leverages Figma Plugin API for seamless integration with Figma's design environment.

## Key Features

- Save and name frame styles as reusable classes.
- Apply saved classes to selected frames for consistency.
- Export and import classes as JSON for collaboration and portability.
- Manage class definitions (rename, update, delete).
- Support for batch application of classes to multiple frames.
- Simple, intuitive UI for easy navigation and class management.
- Real-time updates and feedback while using the plugin.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for advanced styling options like conditional rules.
- Integration with external design systems and cloud storage.
- Enhanced analytics for class usage and design impact tracking.

## Project Highlights

This project aims to fill a critical gap in the Figma ecosystem by enabling reusable, centralized style management, improving productivity and design consistency for teams and individual users alike.
