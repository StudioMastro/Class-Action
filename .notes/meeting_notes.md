# Meeting Notes

## 2024-01-10 - Project Restructuring and Planning

### Project Structure Discussion
- **Issue Identified**: Duplicate files and suboptimal structure for a Figma plugin
- **Decision**: Reorganize project following Figma best practices
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created `/src` directory for source files
  - Moved `code.ts` and `ui.html` to `/src`
  - Updated `tsconfig.json` for new structure
  - Modified `manifest.json` to point to new paths

### Documentation and Best Practices
- **Discussion**: Need to document correct structure for Figma plugins
- **Decision**: Update project overview with clear guidelines
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Added directory structure section to project overview
  - Documented code organization best practices
  - Removed unnecessary post-commit hook
  - Defined recommended folder structure for future expansion

### Publication and Monetization Planning
- **Discussion**: Requirements for Figma Community publication and monetization strategy
- **Decisions**:
  1. Add tasks for Figma Community publication preparation
     - Graphic assets (icons, screenshots)
     - User documentation
     - Promotional materials
  2. Implement monetization strategy
     - Evaluate subscription vs license models
     - Define feature tiers
     - Plan authentication system

### Next Steps
1. Implement complete folder structure in `/src`
2. Begin preparation of publication materials
3. Analyze monetization options in detail

### Technical Notes
- TypeScript configuration updated for root output (`code.js`)
- Manual maintenance of directory structure documentation
- Need to evaluate technical requirements for license/subscription system
