# Init

## Development guide

_This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/)._

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v20
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest…` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

## Features and Limitations

### Supported Frame Properties

The plugin can save and apply the following properties:

- Basic dimensions (width, height)
- Layout mode (auto-layout or fixed)
- Aspect ratio and constraints
- Rotation
- Auto-layout properties (spacing, padding, alignment, etc.)
- Corner radius
- Opacity and blend mode
- Stroke properties (weight, align, dash pattern)

### Style Properties Support

| Property Type | Support Level    | Notes                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Solid Colors  | ✅ Full          | Both direct colors and style references          |
| Gradients     | ⚠️ Partial       | Basic gradient support, may lose some properties |
| Images        | ❌ Not Supported | Image fills are not saved or applied             |
| Videos        | ❌ Not Supported | Video fills are not saved or applied             |
| Effects       | ✅ Full          | Shadows and blur effects are fully supported     |
| Layout Grids  | ✅ Full          | Grid styles are supported                        |

### Known Limitations

#### Image and Video Fills

The plugin currently does not support saving and applying image or video fills. When saving a class from a frame with an image background, the image will not be included in the class and will not be applied when using the class on other frames.

This limitation is due to technical constraints in the Figma API and the need to keep plugin storage size reasonable.

#### Position in Canvas

The plugin intentionally does not save or apply the absolute position (X, Y coordinates) of frames in the canvas. This prevents unwanted overlapping when applying classes to multiple frames and preserves the positioning of frames within auto-layout containers.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console, search for and run `Show/Hide Console` via the Quick Actions search bar.
