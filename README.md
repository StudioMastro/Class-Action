![Class Action Banner](assets/banner.png)

> Transform your Figma workflow with smart frame management and reusable classes.

_This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/)._

## üéØ Why Class Action?

Ever found yourself repeatedly adjusting frame dimensions and properties across your Figma files? Class Action lets you save and reuse frame configurations with a single click, making your design workflow faster and more consistent.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Save Frame Classes**: Create reusable classes from any frame configuration
- **Quick Apply**: Apply saved classes to any frame with one click
- **Smart Search**: Find the right class instantly with our smart search
- **Batch Operations**: Apply classes to multiple frames at once (Premium)
- **Import/Export**: Share your classes across teams and projects (Premium)
- **Unlimited Classes**: Store as many classes as you need (Premium)
- **Variables Support**: Full support for Figma variables (color, numeric, boolean, and string)

## üí° Use Cases

- **Design Systems**: Maintain consistent component containers
- **Responsive Design**: Quickly switch between different frame sizes
- **Layout Templates**: Save and reuse common layout configurations
- **Team Collaboration**: Share standardized frame setups
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Speed up your design workflow

## üé® How It Works

1. **Select** any frame in your design
2. **Save** its properties as a reusable class
3. **Apply** the class to other frames instantly
4. **Organize** your classes with smart search and filtering

```

### Development

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

For more details, see the [Create Figma Plugin docs](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).

3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

## Features and Limitations

### Supported Frame Properties

The plugin can save and apply the following properties:

- Basic dimensions (width, height)
- Layout mode (auto-layout or fixed)
- Aspect ratio and constraints
- Rotation
- Auto-layout properties (spacing, padding, alignment, etc.)
- Corner radius
- Opacity and blend mode
- Stroke properties (weight, align, dash pattern)
- Figma variables (color, numeric, and boolean variables)

### Style Properties Support

| Property Type | Support Level    | Notes                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Solid Colors  | ‚úÖ Full          | Direct colors, style references, and variables   |
| Gradients     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial       | Basic gradient support, may lose some properties |
| Images        | ‚ùå Not Supported | Image fills are not saved or applied             |
| Videos        | ‚ùå Not Supported | Video fills are not saved or applied             |
| Effects       | ‚úÖ Full          | Shadows and blur effects are fully supported     |
| Layout Grids  | ‚úÖ Full          | Grid styles are supported                        |

### Variables Support

| Variable Type | Support Level | Notes                                           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Color         | ‚úÖ Full       | Color variables in fills and strokes            |
| Number        | ‚úÖ Full       | Numeric variables for dimensions, padding, etc. |
| Boolean       | ‚úÖ Full       | Boolean variables are preserved                 |
| String        | ‚úÖ Full       | String variables are preserved                  |

### Known Limitations

#### Image and Video Fills

The plugin currently does not support saving and applying image or video fills. When saving a class from a frame with an image background, the image will not be included in the class and will not be applied when using the class on other frames.

This limitation is due to technical constraints in the Figma API and the need to keep plugin storage size reasonable.

#### Position in Canvas

The plugin intentionally does not save or apply the absolute position (X, Y coordinates) of frames in the canvas. This prevents unwanted overlapping when applying classes to multiple frames and preserves the positioning of frames within auto-layout containers.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console, search for and run `Show/Hide Console` via the Quick Actions search bar.
