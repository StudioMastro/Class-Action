# Class Action - Figma Plugin

Transform how you manage frame styles in Figma! While Figma's native styles let you save and reuse individual properties (like colors or effects), Class Action takes it to the next level by allowing you to capture and reuse entire frame configurations as CSS-like classes.

Imagine being able to save all properties of a frame - from its size and layout to its colors, borders, and effects - as a single, reusable class. Just like in CSS, where a class can define multiple properties at once, Class Action lets you:
- Bundle multiple style properties into one easy-to-use class
- Apply complete frame configurations with a single click
- Maintain consistency across your design system effortlessly
- Update multiple properties simultaneously across your design

No more juggling multiple style properties or manually applying each aspect of a component's design - Class Action handles it all in one go!

## Why Class Action?

### üéØ The Problem with Traditional Styles
Traditional Figma styles are great for managing individual properties, but real-world designs are more complex. Imagine creating a button:
- You need a fill style for the background
- A text style for the typography
- An effect style for the shadow
- Individual properties for border radius, padding, and size

### üí° The Class Action Solution
With Class Action, you can:
1. Create the perfect button once
2. Save ALL its properties as a single class
3. Reuse it anywhere with one click

### üöÄ Real-World Benefits

#### Design System Management
Instead of maintaining dozens of individual styles, manage complete component variations as classes:
- Primary Button
- Secondary Button
- Large Card
- Small Card
- etc.

#### Time-Saving Workflow
Before: 20 clicks to style a component
After: 1 click to apply a class

#### Team Collaboration
Share entire component styles across your team:
- Export your class library
- Import into any Figma file
- Maintain consistency effortlessly

#### Perfect for Complex Components
Ideal for components with multiple properties:
- Cards with specific padding, shadows, and layouts
