# Logging and Monitoring Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for implementing logging and monitoring within the Figma Plugin Project in production environments. The objective is to capture errors and performance issues in a standardized way and to monitor system health proactively.

## Logging Best Practices
- Utilize a standardized logging format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate parsing and searching.
- Include essential information in every log entry, such as:
  - Timestamp
  - Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  - Message content with context (e.g., user ID, session ID, function name)
- Employ logging libraries (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) that support environment-specific configurations.
- Ensure logs do not expose sensitive information.

## Monitoring and Error Reporting
- Integrate with centralized monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for real-time error tracking.
- Monitor critical performance metrics such as response times, memory usage, and resource consumption.
- Set up alerts for critical errors and system degradation.
- Regularly review logs and monitoring dashboards to identify and address recurring issues.

## Integration with CI/CD
- Validate logging configurations during the testing and build stages of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Confirm that all deployed environments generate and capture the expected log entries and monitoring events.

## Recommended Tools
- **Logging Libraries:** Winston, Bunyan, or similar
- **Monitoring Tools:** Sentry, LogRocket, or equivalent services
- **Performance Monitoring:** New Relic, Datadog, or similar
