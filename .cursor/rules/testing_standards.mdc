# Testing Standards and Code Quality Guidelines

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components and functions in isolation
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock Figma API calls appropriately
- Test both success and error cases

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify plugin-to-Figma communication
- Test data flow between components
- Validate UI state management

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify plugin installation and startup
- Test real Figma API interactions
- Validate UI responsiveness

## Code Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical plugin operations
- Track coverage trends in CI/CD

## Testing Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names
- Use meaningful test data
- Avoid test interdependence
- Keep tests focused and concise
- Use proper assertion methods

## Code Quality Checks
- Run ESLint with strict rules
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- Perform TypeScript strict checks
- Review bundle size impacts

## Performance Testing
- Measure render times
- Profile memory usage
- Test with large data sets
- Monitor API call efficiency

## Documentation Requirements
- Document test setup procedures
- Maintain testing guidelines
- Update test documentation
- Include example test cases

## Continuous Integration
- Automate test runs
- Enforce coverage thresholds
- Block merges on test failures
- Generate test reports

## Review Process
- Peer review all test code
- Verify test quality
- Check edge cases coverage
- Validate error handling

## Tools and Libraries
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library
- @figma/plugin-typings
- ESLint and Prettier
- TypeScript compiler
