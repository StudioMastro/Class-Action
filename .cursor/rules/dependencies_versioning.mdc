# Dependencies and Versioning Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the guidelines for managing dependencies and versioning in the Figma Plugin Project. The objective is to ensure that dependencies remain up-to-date and that version increments follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) principles.

## Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies and dev-dependencies.
- Use a package manager (npm or yarn) and maintain lock files for consistent builds.
- Utilize tools such as npm-check-updates to identify and update outdated packages.
- Review changelogs and migration guides for upstream dependencies before upgrading.

## Versioning Guidelines
- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
  - MAJOR: for incompatible API changes.
  - MINOR: for backwards-compatible new features.
  - PATCH: for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- Maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.md documenting release notes and changes.
- Use automated release tools (e.g., semantic-release) to streamline version bumping and changelog generation.

## Tools and Best Practices
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
- **Versioning Tools:** semantic-release or standard-version
- **Changelog Management:** Adopt Conventional Commits to facilitate automated changelog generation
