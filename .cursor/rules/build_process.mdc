# Build Process Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the build process for the Figma Plugin Project. It covers the steps required to compile, bundle, and prepare the plugin for deployment, leveraging @create-figma-plugin/build. It also includes guidelines on integrating Tailwind CSS, Preact, and the license management system where applicable.

## Build Tools and Configurations
- **Bundler/Compiler:** Use the build tools provided by @create-figma-plugin/build for fast and efficient transpilation and bundling
- **Language:** Ensure all code is written in TypeScript in strict mode
- **CSS Framework:** Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring proper configuration for purging unused styles in production
- **UI Library:** Use Preact where needed for lightweight UI components, ensuring proper aliasing if required
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Ensure `tsconfig.json` is properly configured with:
  - `"strict": true` for strict type checking
  - Appropriate `outDir` to prevent overwriting source files
  - Necessary exclusions for JavaScript files that shouldn't be processed

## Create Figma Plugin Integration
- Follow the guidelines from @create-figma-plugin/build to set up the initial project structure
- Ensure the plugin manifest is properly generated and validated as per Figma requirements
- Configure environment-specific settings (development, staging, production) in the build process
- Use the `build-figma-plugin.*.js` configuration files to customize the build process for different environments

## Environment Management
- **Build Modes:** The project supports two build modes:
  - **Development Mode:** Used during development for faster builds and debugging
  - **Production Mode:** Used for creating optimized builds for distribution

- **Build Commands:**
  - Development: `npm run build:dev` or `npm run watch` (for auto-rebuilds)
  - Production: `npm run build` or `npm run build:prod`

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Environment variables are managed through `.env` files:
    - `.env.development`: Contains development-specific variables
    - `.env`: Contains production variables
  - The correct file is automatically loaded based on the build mode
  - Required variables for production:
    - `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY`: API key for LemonSqueezy
    - `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`: Store ID for LemonSqueezy
    - `LEMONSQUEEZY_PRODUCT_ID`: Product ID for LemonSqueezy
    - `LEMONSQUEEZY_CHECKOUT_URL`: Checkout URL for LemonSqueezy

- **Configuration System:**
  - `build-config.js`: Central configuration for environment variables and validation
    - Implements a caching mechanism to ensure configuration is loaded only once
    - Uses a singleton pattern to prevent duplicate environment loading
    - Provides consistent configuration across multiple imports
  - `build-figma-plugin.main.js`: Configuration for the main build process
  - `build-figma-plugin.manifest.js`: Configuration for the manifest generation
  - Both configuration files import and use the same cached configuration instance

## License Management Integration
- Ensure the license management system is properly integrated into the build process
- Include necessary license validation and activation endpoints in the plugin
- Configure proper error handling for license-related operations
- Implement feature toggling based on license tier (free vs premium)
- Ensure license data is securely stored and transmitted
- Include appropriate license status indicators in the UI

## Tailwind CSS Integration
- Configure Tailwind CSS by importing its base, components, and utilities into your main stylesheet
- Use PurgeCSS (or Tailwind's built-in purge feature) to remove unused styles in production builds
- Extract commonly used utility combinations into reusable components when necessary, to enhance maintainability
- Ensure Tailwind's configuration is optimized for the plugin's specific needs

## Preact Integration
- If using Preact, ensure that the JSX pragma is correctly set up (via Babel or TypeScript configuration) to use Preact's `h` and `Fragment`
- Verify proper module aliasing if React is used elsewhere in the project, ensuring consistency with Preact
- Optimize the bundle by leveraging code-splitting and lazy loading (using React.lazy and Suspense when applicable)
- Ensure proper typing for Preact components to maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Build Steps
1. **Environment Setup:** Set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to either `development` or `production`
2. **Configuration Loading:** Load the build configuration from the appropriate `.env` file
   - Configuration is loaded only once and cached for subsequent imports
   - The same configuration instance is used across all build processes
3. **Configuration Validation:** Validate the configuration (stricter validation for production builds)
4. **Transpilation:** Convert TypeScript code to JavaScript using a compiler (tsc or through the bundler)
5. **Bundling:** Bundle the code using the chosen build tool
6. **Minification:** Apply minification and dead code elimination for production builds
7. **Asset Management:** Copy static assets (images, fonts, etc.) to the appropriate output directories
8. **Manifest Generation:** Automatically generate or validate the Figma Plugin manifest
9. **Testing the Build:** Run automated tests (unit, integration) as part of the build pipeline
10. **Verification:** Inspect the final build output to ensure compliance with Figma's plugin requirements

## CI/CD Integration
- Integrate the build process into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment
- Ensure that the build stage verifies type safety, code quality (linting, formatting), and bundle size limits
- Implement automated testing for license management functionality
- Configure different deployment targets based on build environment (development, staging, production)
- Set up proper versioning and release management

## Troubleshooting Common Build Issues
- **TypeScript Compilation Errors:** Ensure proper configuration in `tsconfig.json`, especially regarding file exclusions and output directory
- **Bundle Size Issues:** Analyze and optimize dependencies, implement code splitting where appropriate
- **License Validation Failures:** Check API endpoints, request parameters, and error handling
- **CSS Purging Problems:** Verify Tailwind configuration and ensure proper class usage patterns
- **Manifest Generation Errors:** Check for invalid plugin configuration or missing required fields
- **Environment Variables Issues:**
  - Check that you have the correct `.env` files in the project root
  - Verify that all required variables are defined in the file
  - Make sure the values are correct
  - Check the console output during the build process to see which environment is being used
- **Duplicate Configuration Loading:**
  - If you see environment variables being loaded multiple times in the build output
  - Check that the caching mechanism in `build-config.js` is working correctly
  - Ensure that all configuration files are importing the same instance of the configuration
  - Verify that the `cachedConfig` variable is being properly utilized

## Additional Considerations from Figma Official Documentation

- **Plugin Linter:** Figma provides a set of TypeScript ESLint rules to automatically catch and fix issues in plugin code
- **TypeScript Compilation:** Since Figma plugins run in the browser, they require a JavaScript output
- **Dynamic Page Loading:** For plugins that support Figma's dynamic page loading feature, additional manifest configuration is needed
- **Advanced Manifest Customization:** Utilize custom build configuration files to modify the manifest output before deployment
- **Performance Optimization:** Follow Figma's guidelines for optimizing plugin performance, especially for operations on large files
