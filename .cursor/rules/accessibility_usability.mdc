# Accessibility and Usability Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for ensuring that the Figma Plugin Project meets accessibility standards and delivers a user-friendly experience. The objective is to ensure that the plugin interface is accessible for all users, including those with disabilities, and follows industry best practices for usability.

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines as a baseline for accessibility.
- Ensure all user interface components have appropriate ARIA attributes.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background elements.
- Support keyboard navigation and proper focus management.
- Implement accessible forms and inputs with descriptive labels.
- Use automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) and perform manual reviews.

## Usability Guidelines
- Design an intuitive and straightforward user interface.
- Maintain consistent design patterns and interaction flows across the plugin.
- Provide clear feedback for user actions.
- Optimize performance to minimize delays and enhance the user experience.
- Document interactive components with clear usage instructions.
- Collect and incorporate user feedback to continuously improve usability.

## Tools and Best Practices
- **Accessibility Testing Tools:** Axe, Lighthouse, or similar.
- **Design Systems:** Adhere to Figma's design system and component guidelines.
- **User Testing:** Conduct usability tests with a diverse group of users.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement in-app feedback options to gather user insights.

## Integration with CI/CD
- Include automated accessibility checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Validate that all builds meet the outlined accessibility requirements.
